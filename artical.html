			<h3>About our artical</h3>
			<p>Looking back on that horrible summer, I soon understood that all succeeding good things merely offset the bad. Worse than normal wouldn’t last long. I am owed and savor the halcyon times. The reinvigorate me for the next nasty surprise and offer assurance that can thrive. The 50-percent theory even helps me see hope beyond my Royals’ recent slump, a field of struggling rookies sown so that some year soon we can reap an October harvest.The next time you find yourself in the middle of a very stressful time, or you feel angry or frustrated, stop. Yes, that’s right, stop. Whatever you’re doing, stop and sit for one minute.  </p>

			<p>Take a moment to let the goodness of life <strong class="str1">touch your spirit</strong> and calm your thoughts. Then, share your good fortune with another. For the goodness of life grows more and more magnificent each time it is given away.Though the problems constantly scream for <strong class="str2">attention and the conflicts</strong> appear to rage ever stronger, the goodness of life grows stronger still, <strong class="str3">quietly, peacefully,</strong> with more purpose and meaning than ever before.</p>

			<p>Let me tell you about five of the other enemies we face from within. <em>The first enemy that you’ve got</em> to destroy before it destroys you is indifference. <b>What a tragic disease</b> this is! “Ho-hum, let it slide. I’ll just drift along.” Here’s one problem with drifting: <i>you can’t drift your way</i> to the to of the mountain. </p>

			<h3>Pop artical A</h3>
			<img src="./images/artical01.png" /><p>The third enemy inside is doubt. Sure, there’s room for healthy skepticism. You can’t believe everything. But you also can’t let doubt take over. Many people doubt the past, doubt the future, doubt each other, doubt the government, doubt the possibilities nad doubt the opportunities. Worse of all, they doubt themselves. I’m telling you, doubt will destroy your life and your chances of success. It will empty both your bank account and your heart. Doubt is an enemy. Go after it. Get rid of it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="div2">
			<h3>Pop artical B</h3>
			<img src="./images/artical02.png" /><p>The fourth enemy within is worry. We’ve all got to worry some. Just don’t let conquer you. Instead, let it alarm you. Worry can be useful. If you step off the curb in New York City and a taxi is coming, you’ve got to worry. But you can’t let worry loose like a mad dog that drives you into a small corner. Here’s what you’ve got to do with your worries: drive them into a small corner. Whatever is out to get you, you’ve got to get it. Whatever is pushing on you, you’ve got to push back. </p>

		<h3>Blockquote</h3>
		<p>Abundance is a life style, a way of living your life. It isn’t something you buy now and then or pull down from the cupboard, dust off and use once or twice, and then return to the cupboard.</p>
		<div class="p_box"><i></i><p class="p2">Abundance doesn’t always require money. Many people live with all that money can buy yet live empty inside. Abundance begins inside with some main self-ingredients, like love, care, kindness and gentleness, thoughtfulness and compassion. Abundance is a state of being. It radiates outward. It shines like the sun among the many moons in the world.Be in a state of abundance of what you already have. I guarantee they are there; it always is buried but there. Breathe them in as if they are the air you breathe because they are yours. Let go of anything that isn’t abundant for the time being. Name the shoe boxes in your closet with your gifts of abundance; pull from them every morning if needed. Know they are there.</p><div class="clear"></div></div>

			<h3>People in your life</h3>
			<p><i>When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually.They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. Sometimes they die.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="real1 real_right">
			<h3>The happy door</h3>
			<p><i>There is no exact definition of the word happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. The key is not wealth or physical well-being, since we find beggars, invalids and so-called failures, who are extremely happy.Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend. But staying happy is an accomplishment, a triumph of soul and character. It is not selfish to strive for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="real2">
			<h3>The Color of Friendship</h3>
			<p><i>Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. The rain continued: "From now on, when it rains, each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder that you can all live in peace. The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow." And so, whenever a good rain washes the world, and a Rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another. </i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="real2">
			<h3>Love your life</h3>
			<p><i>However mean your life is,meet it and live it ;do not shun it and call it hardnames.It is not so bad as you suppose.It looks poorest when you are richest.The fault-finder will find faults in paradise.Love your life,poor as it is.You may perhaps have some pleasant,thrilling,glorious hourss,even in a poor-house.The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man's abode;the snow melts before its door as early in the spring.</i></p>

		<div class="real2 real_right">
			<h3>If were a boy again</h3>
			<p><i>If I were a boy again,I would school myself to say “No”oftener.I might write pages on the importance of learning very early in life to gain that point where a young boy can stand erect,and decline doing an unworthy act because it is unworthy.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="real3">
			<h3>Relish the Moment</h3>
			<p><i>“Relish the moment” is a good motto, especially when coupled with Psalm 118:24: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” It isn’t the burdens of today that drive men mad.</i></p>
		</div>

			<h3>with tolerance</h3>
			<p><i>There is not much to choose between men. They are all a hotchpotch of greatness and tininess, of virtue and vice, of nobility and baseness. </i></p>

			<h3>Industry significance</h3>
			<p><i>Labor vanquishes all --- not inconstant, spasmodic, or ill-directed labor, but faithful, unremitting, daily effort toward a well-directed purpose. Just as truly as eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, so is eternal industry the price of noble and enduring success</i></p>
