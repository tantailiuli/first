				<h2>Lorem ispsum dolor emnet. </h2>
				<p>Welcome to FlatLab!The same lethargy, I am afraid, characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses. Only the deaf appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight. Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life. But those who have never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties. Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily, without concentration and with little appreciation. It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not being conscious of health until we are ill. I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. <br/><br/>The great and good do not die, even in this world. Embalmed in books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is an intellect to which on still listens. </p>

			<h1>OUR SERVICES</h1>
			<p>Have a good mood, happy every day to face life is a lot of people's ideal life state. What can I do to keep myself in good mood?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3>Start each day with expectation</h3>
				<p>If there's any big truth about life, it's that it usually lives up to (or down to) your expectations. Therefore, when you rise from bed, make your first thought: "something wonderful is going to happen today." Guess what? You're probably right.</p></div></li>
				<li class="li2"><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3> Take time to plan and prioritize</h3>
				<p>The most common source of stress is the perception that you've got too much work to do. Rather than obsess about it, pick one thing that, if you get it done today, will move you closer to your highest goal and purpose in life.</p></div></li>
				<li><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3>Give a gift to everyone you meet</h3>
				<p>I'm not talking about a formal, wrapped-up present. Your gift can be your smile, a word of thanks or encouragement, a gesture of politeness, even a friendly nod. And never pass beggars without leaving them something. </p></div></li>
				<li class="li4"><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3>Responsive design</h3>
				<p>Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties.</p></div></li>
				<li><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3>Assume people have good intentions</h3>
				<p>Since you can't read minds, you don't really know the "why" behind the "what" that people do. Imputing evil motives to other people's weird behaviors adds extra misery to life, while assuming good intentions leaves you open to reconciliation.</p></div></li>
				<li class="li6"><div class="div1"></div><div class="div2"><h3>End each day with gratitude</h3>
				<p>Just before you go to bed, write down at least one wonderful thing that happened. It might be something as small as a making a child laugh or something as huge as a million dollar deal. Whatever it is, be grateful for that day because it will never come again.</p></div></li>

		<p>I met Connie the day she was admitted to the hospice ward, where I worked as a volunteer. Her husband, Bill, stood nervously nearby as she was transferred from the gurney to the hospital bed. Although Connie was in the final stages of her fight against cancer, she was alert and cheerful.</p>
