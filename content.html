		<ul id="aa">
			<li><span>Love Life</span><div class="nav1"><div class="circle_box"><div class="circle"></div></div><p>To a large degree，the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment．Irrespective of what happened yesterday or last year，and what may or may not happen tomorrow，the present moment is where you are －－always．<br/><br/>Without question，many of us have mastered the neurotic art of spending much of our lives worrying about a variety of things －－all at once．We allow past problems and future concerns to dominate our present moments，so much so that we end up anxious，frustrated，depressed，and hopeless．<br/><br/>On the flip side，we also postpone our gratification，our stated priorities，and our happiness，often convincing ourselves that ‘someday’ will be better than today．Unfortunately，the same mental dynamics that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat themselves so that "someday " never actually arrives．<br/><br/>John Lennon once said，‘Life is what’s happening while we’re busy making other plans．’When we’re busy making ‘other plans’，our children are busy growing up，the people we love are moving away and dying，our bodies are getting out of shape，and our dreams are slipping away．In short，we miss out on life．<br/><br/>Many people live as if life were a dress rehearsal5 for some later date．It isn’t．In fact，no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow．Now is the only time we have，and the only time that we have any control over．When our attention is in the present moment，we push fear from our minds．Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future－－we won’ t have enough money，our children will get into trouble，we will get old and die，whatever．<br/><br/>To combat fear，the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present．Mark Twain said，‘I have been through some terrible things in my life，some of which actually happened．I don’t think I can say it any better．Practice keeping your attention on the here and now．Your efforts will pay great dividends．<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></li>
			<li><span>Life is a gift</span><div class="nav1"><div class="circle_box"><div class="circle"></div></div><p>Today before you think of saying an unkind word, <br/><br/>Think of someone who can't speak. <br/><br/>Before you complain about the taste of your food, <br/><br/>Think of someone who has nothing to eat. <br/><br/>Before you complain about your husband or wife, <br/><br/>Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion. <br/><br/>Today before you complain about life, <br/><br/>Think of someone who went too early to heaven. <br/><br/>Before you complain about your children, <br/><br/>Think of someone who desires children but they're barren.<br/><br/>Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep, <br/><br/>Think of the people who are living in the streets.<br/><br/>Before whining about the distance you drive, <br/><br/>Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.<br/><br/>And when you are tired and complain about your job, <br/><br/>Think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job. <br/><br/>But before you think of pointing your finger or condemning another, <br/><br/>Remember that not one of us is without sin and we all answer to one maker.<br/><br/>And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down, <br/><br/>Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around. <br/><br/>Life is a gift, <br/><br/>Enjoy it, <br/><br/>Celebrate it,<br/><br/>And fulfill it... <br/><br/>And while you want to give love to someone today, <br/><br/>Love someone with what you do and the words you say，<br/><br/>Love is not meant to be kept locked inside of us and hidden, <br/><br/>So give it away" Give love to someone today!"<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></li>
			<li><span>The Color of Friendship</span><div class="nav1"><div class="circle_box"><div class="circle"></div></div><p>Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel. All claimed that they were the best. The most important.The most useful.The favorite.<br/><br/>Green said: "Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and of hope. I was chosen for grass, trees and leaves. Without me, all animals would die. Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority."<br/><br/>Blue interrupted: "You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea. It is the water that is the basis of life and drawn up by the clouds from the deep sea. Without my peace, you would all be nothing."  <br/><br/>Yellow chuckled:  "You are all so serious. I bring laughter, gaiety, and warmth into the world. The sun is yellow, the moon is yellow, and the stars are yellow. Every time you look at a sunflower, the whole world starts to smile. Without me there would be no fun."<br/><br/>Orange started next to blow her trumpet:  "I am the color of health and strength. I may be scarce, but I am precious for I serve the needs of human life. I carry the most important vitamins. Think of carrots, pumpkins, oranges, mangoes, and papayas. I don't hang around all the time, but when I fill the sky at sunrise or sunset, my beauty is so striking that no one gives another thought to any of you."  <br/><br/>Red couldn't stand it no longer he shouted out: "I am the ruler of all of you. I am blood - life's blood! I am the color of danger and of bravery. I am willing to fight for a cause. I bring fire into the blood. Without me, the earth would be as empty as the moon. I am the color of passion and of love, the red rose, the poinsettia and the poppy.<br/><br/>Purple rose up to his full height: He was very tall and spoke with great pomp: "I am the color of royalty and power. Kings, chiefs, and bishops have always chosen me for I am the sign of authority and wisdom. People do not question me! They listen and obey." <br/><br/>Finally Indigo spoke, much more quietly than all the others, but with just as much determination: "Think of me. I am the color of silence. You hardly notice me, but without me you all become superficial. I represent thought and reflection, twilight and deep water. You need me for balance and contrast, for prayer and inner peace."<br/><br/>And so the colors went on boasting, each convinced of his or her own superiority. Their quarreling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed. Rain started to pour down relentlessly. The colors crouched down in fear, drawing close to one another for comfort.  <br/><br/>In the midst of the clamor, rain began to speak: "You foolish colors, fighting amongst yourselves, each trying to dominate the rest. Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different? Join hands with one another and come to me."<br/><br/>Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. The rain continued: "From now on, when it rains, each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder that you can all live in peace. The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow." And so, whenever a good rain washes the world, and a Rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></li>
			<li><span>Promise</span><div class="nav1"><div class="circle_box"><div class="circle"></div></div><p>In 1989 an 8.2 earthquake almost flattened America, killing over 30,000 people in less than four minutes. In the midst of utter devastation and chaos, a father left his wife safely at home and rushed to the school where his son was supposed to be, only to discover that the building was as flat as a pancake.<br/><br/>After the unforgettably initial shock, he remembered the promise he had made to his son: "No matter what, I’ll always be there for you!" And tears began to fill his eyes. As he looked at the pile of ruins that once was the school, it looked hopeless, but he kept remembering his commitment to his son.<br/><br/>He began to direct his attention towards where he walked his son to class at school each morning. Remembering his son s classroom would be in the back right corner of the building; he rushed there and started digging through the ruins.<br/><br/>As he was digging, other helpless parents arrived, clutching their hearts, saying: "My son!" "My daughter!" Other well meaning parents tried to pull him off what was left of the school, saying: "It s too late! They’re all dead! You can’t help! Go home! Come on, face reality, there s nothing you can do!"<br/><br/>To each parent he responded with one line: "Are you going to help me now?" And then he continued to dig for his son, stone by stone. The fire chief showed up and tried to pull him off the school s ruins saying, "Fires are breaking out, explosions are happening everywhere. You’re in danger. We’ll take care of it. Go home." To which this loving, caring American father asked, "Are you going to help me now?"<br/><br/>The police came and said, "You’re angry, anxious and it s over. You’re endangering others. Go home. We’ll handle it!" To which he replied, "Are you going to help me now?" No one helped.Courageously he went on alone because he needed to know for himself: "Is my boy alive or is he dead?" He dug for eight hours...12 hours...24 hours...36 hours...then, in the 38th hour, he pulled back a large stone and heard his son s voice. He screamed his son s name, "ARMAND!" He heard back, "Dad!?! It s me, Dad! I told the other kids not to worry. I told them that if you were alive, you d save me and when you saved me, they d be saved. You promised, No matter what happens, I’ll always be there for you! You did it, Dad!" "What s going on in there? How is it?" the father asked.<br/><br/>"There are 14 of us left out of 33, Dad. We’re scared, hungry, thirsty and thankful you re here. When the building collapsed, it made a triangle, and it saved us."<br/><br/>"Come out, boy!"<br/><br/>"No, Dad! Let the other kids out first, cause I know you ll get me! No matter what happens, I know you’ll always be there for me!"<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></li>
			<li><span>Catch of a lifetime</span><div class="nav1"><div class="circle_box"><div class="circle"></div></div><p>He was 11 and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin.<br/><br/>On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. When his peapole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully worked the fish alongside the dock.<br/><br/>Finally, he lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but is was a bass.<br/><br/>The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.----two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy.<br/><br/>"You'll have to put it back, son." he said.<br/><br/>"Dad!" cried the boy.<br/><br/>"There will be other fish," said his father.<br/><br/>"Not as big as this one," cried the boy.<br/><br/>He looked around the lake. No others were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could tell by the clarity of his father's voice that the decision was not negotiable. He slowly worked the hook out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish.<br/><br/>That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock.<br/><br/>And he was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish---again and again---every time he comes up against a question of ethics.<br/><br/>For, as his father taught him, ethics are simple matters of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethics that is difficult. Do we do right when no one is looking? Do we refuse to cut corners to get the design in on time? Or refuse to trade stocks based on information that we know we aren't supposed to have?<br/><br/>We would if we were taught to put the fish back when we were young. For we would have learned the truth. The decision to do right lives fresh and fragrant in our memory.<br/><br/>It is a story we will proudly tell our friends and grandchildren. Not about how we had a chance to beat the system and took it， but about how we did the right thing and were forever  strengthened.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></li>
